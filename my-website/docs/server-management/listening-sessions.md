The Listening Sessions page includes all previous and current listening sessions.

Previous listening sessions can be deleted from the extra details popup or by selecting listening sessions from the table, and currently open listening sessions can also be closed from this page.

The table can be filtered by specific users and sorted by each of the columns. Clicking on each row shows additional information for the listening session, including the device playback occurred on for additional debugging.

Listening sessions are an important part of keeping stats accurate. Stats are calculated based on listening sessions. Listening sessions should be kept and not deleted.
