Podcasts are defined as folders. Audiobookshelf only supports podcasts in a flat directory structure (meaning no season folders). Each podcast can have a single cover image, which must be placed in the same folder as the episode files. Each audio file is a separate podcast episode.

## File Metadata

When scanning podcast files from the filesystem, the metadata for the podcast is read from the first audio file encountered.
